## NFT history / OG Collections
 
* CryptoPunks / founders: Larva Labs John Watkinson (https://twitter.com/pents90) and Matt Hall (https://twitter.com/matthall2000) 
* Rare Pepe : In September 2016, the very first rare Pepes were mined in block 428919 on Bitcoin (on Counterparty NFT platform), pre-dating popular Ethereum based NFTs. On October 26, 2021, a rare Pepe, PEPENOPOULOS sold at a Sotheby's auction for $3.6m USD. / founder : Joe Looney https://twitter.com/wasthatawolf
* EtherRocks: the most expensive ones (only 100), price pumped when Gary Vee talked about it in 2021 
* CryptoKitties : Breeding game, played this game at the end of 2017, was for a month the number one dapp using the most gas fees. Only the Genesis (Generation 0) kitties still hold some value, because this game has no capped supply for the other generations, you can breed them almost as much as you want (however, some with good genes can reproduce faster than others). / founders: https://twitter.com/dapperlabs, by Roham Gharegozlou https://twitter.com/roham

https://topshotfund.substack.com/p/nftinfluencers containing these classification of NFT influencers:

We can do better by using IPFS (links are uniquely related to the hash of the metadata but data can still disappear) or even better by using Arweave (in theory, the storage is permanent “permaweb” tech)

## NFT DAOs
 
* PleasrDAO (https://twitter.com/PleasrDAO)
* OpenDAO ($SOS, https://twitter.com/The_OpenDAO) : also own a prediction market for NFTs and an NFT launchpad (https://twitter.com/721Starter)
* eGirl Capital (https://twitter.com/egirl_capital)
* UltraDAO (https://twitter.com/Ultra_DAO)
* TreasureDAO
* LooksRare - NFT Marketplace (https://twitter.com/LooksRareNFT) : not really a DAO but a marketplace bootstraped with an airdrop for opensea users (like $SOS ). Very interesting tokenomics (2% fees instead of 2.5% like opensea AND buyers get a cashback in $LOOKS compensating sometimes totally those fees, which incentivizes wash trading and huge volume, greater than opensea)
